BUGS

1)	Fix texture coordinate bug in stream blitter. Try animating. See
	normal blitter for reference of how to fix. (Something along the
	lines of u = u + sx*-pDst).
2)	Blitting does not render last pixel of source i.e. [width-1] and
	[height-1]. THINK THIS IS FIXED!
	
FEATURES
1)	Add support for rotations. This will not be blitting by definition,
	but rather polygon rendering. Also, add support for custom sampling
	and blit predicates.
2)	Bilinear sampling + alpha blending/color key looks horrible. See
	if there is a workaround that does not involve big performance
	tradeoff.
3)	Find a more elegant solution to the problem regarding objects as
 	default arguments (static globals cause access violation).
4)	4x FSAA does not work properly. 2x works fine.
5)	Add support for "moving" blocks of pixels to another destination
	of the buffer without allocating an intermediate buffer. Good
	for streaming, since the point of streaming is to keep memory
	consumption down and also keeps streaming to a minimum.
